- better initial formula input
- more user affordance (highlight clickable stuff)
- interface for quantifiers
- figure out better layout css (looks bad in Chrome)
- user error handling

- we should check for alpha-equivalence for state synchronizing, but
  we don't (example: forall x, P(x) -> forall x, P(x))

- Idea for dynamic updating: start off with the extra thing but at
  display:none; (width/height zero), then have it be empty but expand
  out (to allocate space) and then add in the text
- Studies about latency/timeouts: what should we do while the user
  is waiting for a response?  What about /purposeful/ latency
  for CPU reasons (think of download websites) or for pedagogical
  purposes (don't spam me with guesses)
